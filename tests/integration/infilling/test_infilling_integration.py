# Tests to write:
# - just basic infilling
# - error if try to infill something that isn't there
# - error if one scenario is missing required lead gas
# - works for multiple scenarios with different missing variables
# - config passed correctly (infill with silicone in test,
#   make sure same result comes through via config)
