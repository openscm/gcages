"""
Reaggregation of timeseries from raw reporting to sectors needed for gridding

This is a data problem i.e. the code is highly coupled with the data we expect.
Writing this in a general way is extremely difficult,
hence why the modules are standalone rather than sharing definitions
(which creates a coupling which is incredibly difficult to reason through).
