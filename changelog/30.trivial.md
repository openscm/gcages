Updated the way that the reporting sectors are defined in `gcages.cmip7_scenariomip.pre_processing.reaggregation.basic`.
We no longer use `GriddingSectorComponentsReporting`,
instead we have `GriddingSectorComponents` and `GriddingSectorComponentsCarbonRemovalReporting`
to make the handling of carbon removal clearer.
