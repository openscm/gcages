Split out the Carbon Removal variable tree in a way that better facilitates downstream spatial downscaling.
This means that we no longer split out `Carbon Removal|Geological Storage|Other Sources` and `Carbon Removal|Geological Storage|Synthetic Fuels`, and have created four new gridding sector components:

- `Other CDR` (based on the emissions tree)
- `Enhanced Weathering`, `Direct Air Capture`, `Ocean` (based on the carbon removal tree)
