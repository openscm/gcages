Splitted out all Carbon Removal variables not directly related to land use and enabled spatial downscaling for them.
Removed accounting for `Geological Storage|Other Sources` and `Geological Storage|Synthetic Fuels`.
Created four new gridding sector components:
- `Other CDR` (Emission tree);
- `Enhanced Weathering`, `Direct Air Capture`, `Ocean` (Carbon Removal tree).
