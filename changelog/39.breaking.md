Splitted out all Carbon Removal variables that are not directly related to land use and we can do the spatial downscaling for thereof.
Removed `Geological Storage|Other Sources` and `Geological Storage|Synthetic Fuels` accounting.
Created 4 new gridding sector components:
- `Other CDR` (Emission tree);
- `Enhanced Weathering`, `Direct Air Capture`, `Ocean` (Carbon Removal tree).
